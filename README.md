## Introduction

The One-Time Pad (OTP) is a type of encryption that is theoretically unbreakable when used correctly. This project demonstrates the implementation of an OTP Stream Cipher, which encrypts and decrypts messages using a key that is as long as the message itself.

## Features

- Encrypt messages using OTP Stream Cipher
- Decrypt messages using OTP Stream Cipher
- Generate random keys for encryption

## Installation

To use this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OTP-Stream-Cipher.git
cd OTP-Stream-Cipher
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To excuete the modules run the following command:

```bash
python  main.py --i "Your input file path" --o "Your output file path" --c "Your config file path"
```
